  <h1>Selling ad inventory optimally</h1>
  <h2>A series of post on holistic yield management</h2>
  <dt-byline></dt-byline>
  <h2 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h2>

<p>This blog post is the first of a series of posts aiming at covering theoretical and technical considerations around the optimal ways for a digital publisher to both reserve inventory for <em>direct campaigns</em> and sell the remaining on the spot market, also called <em>real time bidding</em> market or <em>RTB</em>.
The posts will cover the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What does an optimal allocation of <em>direct</em> and <em>RTB</em> look like?</li>
  <li>How to manage a large number of direct campaigns and handle inventory shortage gracefuly?</li>
  <li>How to anticipate daily volume in a smart way?</li>
  <li>How to deal with market uncertainty?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-holistic-yield">What is holistic yield?</h2>

<p>Web publishers use different channels to sell their ads.
We consider in this series of post two channels: real time bidding (<em>RTB</em>) and <em>direct</em>.
In <em>RTB</em>, the publisher sells ads through an ad exchange where buyers compete in auctions happening in real time.
In <em>direct</em>, the ads are sold through direct campaigns.</p>

<p>A direct campaign is a contract in which a publisher commits to deliver a specified number of ads to an advertiser while ensuring that some KPIs are met (for example the publisher may guarantee a minimum number of clicks to the advertiser).
Should the publisher not deliver the impressions as defined in the contract, it pays a penalty to the advertiser.</p>

<p>A natural way for a publisher to allocate impressions between the two channels is to derive a bidding strategy from direct campaigns and let those bids compete against RTB.
If direct wins an auction, the publisher chooses a direct campaign to sell the impression, otherwise the impression is sold in the RTB market.</p>

<p>This post presents an algorithm to build an optimal bidding strategy for the publisher to deliver its direct campaigns while maximizing its RTB revenue.
The optimal strategy gives a formula to determine the publisher bid as well as a way to choose the direct campaign being delivered if the publisher bidder wins the auction, depending on the impression characteristics.</p>

<p>The optimal strategy can be estimated on past auctions data. The algorithm scales with the size of the dataset and the number of campaigns.
This is a very important feature, as in practice a publisher may have thousands of active direct campaigns at the same time and would like to estimate an optimal strategy on millions of auctions.</p>

<h2 id="related-works">Related works</h2>

<p>The problem of maximizing a web publisher advertising revenue is much studied in the literature.
Because of the complexity of the online advertising ecosystem, and because the publishers sell their ads through different channels, this problem leads to diverse approaches.</p>

<p><span></span><dt-cite key="ostrovsky2011reserve"></dt-cite>, <dt-cite key="yuan2014empirical"></dt-cite> and <dt-cite key="chahuara2017real"></dt-cite> consider a publisher selling its ads through <em>RTB</em> only, and define strategies for the publisher to set appropriate reserve prices in each auction to optimize its <em>RTB</em> revenue. In <dt-cite key="ostrovsky2011reserve"></dt-cite>, the reserve prices are set in a static way (i.e an optimal reserve price is estimated on a large set of auctions), whereas <dt-cite key="yuan2014empirical"></dt-cite> and <dt-cite key="chahuara2017real"></dt-cite> define methodologies to set dynamic reserve prices which are predicted in real time before an auction happens.</p>

<p><span></span><dt-cite key="murali2015optimal"></dt-cite> and <dt-cite key="lee2013real"></dt-cite> study the optimal delivery of a budget across time in the <em>RTB</em> market. This problem known as budget pacing has been much studied and presents strong similarities with the problem of delivering a direct campaign. In both articles, the bids are updated online to optimize the budget delivery.</p>

<p><span></span><dt-cite key="roels2009dynamic"></dt-cite> and <dt-cite key="bharadwaj2012shale"></dt-cite> focus on <em>direct</em> revenue maximization. They consider that the impressions can be sold in direct campaigns only, and define strategies to allocate optimally a set of impressions between all campaigns in order to maximize the publisher revenue (i.e minimize the penalty the publisher pays if some campaigns are not delivered as agreed in the contract). <dt-cite key="roels2009dynamic"></dt-cite> formulates this problem as a dynamic programming problem, and <dt-cite key="bharadwaj2012shale"></dt-cite> proposes an efficient algorithm to allocate near-optimally the impresions between the campaigns.</p>

<p><span></span><dt-cite key="ghosh2009bidding"></dt-cite>, <dt-cite key="chen2014dynamic"></dt-cite>, <dt-cite key="chen2016risk"></dt-cite> and <dt-cite key="balseiro2014yield"></dt-cite> study the joint optimization of the publisher revenue coming from <em>RTB</em> and <em>direct</em>. They consider a setting similar to our setting, in which the publisher bids in auctions to compete with <em>RTB</em> bidders.</p>

<p>In <dt-cite key="ghosh2009bidding"></dt-cite>, the quality of a direct campaign delivery is represented by a utility function, and the quality of each impression is linked directly to its price in the <em>RTB</em> market, whereas we characterize a campaign delivery by some KPIs.</p>

<p>The model used in <dt-cite key="chen2014dynamic"></dt-cite> and <dt-cite key="chen2016risk"></dt-cite> is based on the modeling of the supply and the demand on an aggregated level, while we analyze data auction per auction without needing to model the supply and demand.</p>

<p>In <dt-cite key="balseiro2014yield"></dt-cite>, a campaign is defined by a fixed number of impressions which is supposed to be delivered exactly, and a per-impression quality. The algorithm aims to maximize a weighted sum of the <em>RTB</em> revenue and of the direct campaigns qualities. The main difference with our approach is that the campaigns are supposed to be completely delivered. In our approach, we enable under-delivery of a campaign if it brings a higher revenue to the publisher, which adds many variables to the problem. Also, the approach described in <dt-cite key="balseiro2014yield"></dt-cite> may be hard to scale due to the allocation plan used to allocate similar campaigns. We solve this issue using randomization.</p>

<p>Finally, <dt-cite key="wang2012selling"></dt-cite> and <dt-cite key="chen2015financial"></dt-cite> present stochastic models for supply and demand, and link the problem of <em>direct</em> revenue maximization with the problem of option pricing in finance.</p>
